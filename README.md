# basic-mixins

This repository contains the source code for the [Basic Mixins](https://packages.opentap.io/#name=%2FPackages%2FBasic+Mixins&version=any&os=Windows%2CLinux%2CMacos&architecture=AnyCPU) plugin.
Mixins are small units of functionality that can be integrated, or 'mixed in', with an object. In the context of OpenTAP, they are be used for extending the capabilities of e.g. a test step.

These mixins are intended to be generic, and can be used as-is by installing the plugin. They should also be instructive as a primer on how to write your own custom mixins.
